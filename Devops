DevOps

Devops is not a tool but a process.

First Tool
Source Code Management:

Dev/Tester gives code. called source code.
to maintain the source code, we need source code management tools

Version COntrol System:

-Keep track of changes done

Types of VCS:
CVCS> Centralized version control system
DVCS> Distributed version control System

CVCS:
All our code is in a centralized server.
When multiple developers add their code to the same version of source code. the cvcs had trouble deciding which to be put first.

so cvcs has lock in and check in of code.

once checked in by a developer, the code will be unavailable for modification to other developers.

DVCS:
All code will be available to all developers.

Popular Tools are, git/github, gitlab, source tree, tortoise git, bit bucket.
